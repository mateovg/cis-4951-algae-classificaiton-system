Algae is a problem in Miami/Florida. Due to runoff of water (nitrogen) into the ocean and cause blooms -> suffocates plants due of exhausting oxygen.  

Different types in the same field of view.

Security cameras are ubiquitous. $12 camera used by last group. Got samples from lake in FIU. 

YT - algae field microscope. 

Final product - microscope with camera that automatically tells which algae it is, count, etc.

Last group were able to interface the camera with laptop and do processing on laptop. Wants to do AI model on camera (lol?) maybe cloud?
